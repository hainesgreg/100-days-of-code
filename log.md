# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tues 22nd Nov 2022

**About Me**: I started the 100DaysOfCode challenge today, focusing on learning Python. I work in the cloud computing domain (AWS/GCP) and have good open source tooling knowlegde (Terraform, Docker etc), but my coding skills (or lack of) have always held me back. I've attempted to learn to code more time that I care to remember, today I made the decision to stop making excuses, today is the day I hold myself accountable. 

To begin with I wont be working on projects whilst i get a proper handel on the basics, hopefully this is something i'll be capable of by day 30.

**What I Covered Today**: Today ive been working with operators(= == != < >), control flow and had an intro to conditionals(if/else/elif).

**Thoughts:** I now have a good handel on the above concepts, still have a bit mote work to do on if/elif/else, wil have another hour on this subject tomorrow before moving on.

**Todays Output:** Today ive been working on writing a BMI calculator and also an app to tell you if a given year is a leap year, or not.


### Day 2: Weds 23rd, Nov 2022

**What I Covered Today**: Continued on with conditionals today, nested and multiple if statements.

**Thoughts**: Was difficult to understand to begin with but got my head around it eventually. Still a bit more on conditionals to do tomorrow, where we take a look at logical operators(AND / OR / NOT). 

**Todays Output:** I worked on a writing a pizza order app where i got to put my nested and multiple if statement knowledge to the test.


### Day 3: Friday 25th, Nov 2022

**What I Covered Today**: Continued on with conditionals and tackled logical operators (AND / OR / NOT) today.

**Thoughts** The introduction of logical operator answered a few questions i had going around in my head, together with conditionals they start to make things make more sense. Only the final project left in this section where all of the skills used thus far will come into play, will tackle that on Monday as its the weekend tomorrow and my head needs a rest. Very much enjoying the journey so far, taking small bitesize chunks of information onboard is working well for me so will continue in this fashion going forward. 

***Todays Output:** I created a true love calculator where you had to use the logical operator knowledge and also some built-in functions too, (count) and (lower).

### Day 4: Monday 28th, Nov 2022

**What I Covered Today**: Started learning Lists[] and indexing them today. Also got exposure to the more built-in functions, random and split. Not feeling very well today so its been a pretty slow day, finding it hard to concentrate.

**Thoughts** 

***Todays Output:**
