# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tues 22nd Nov 2022

**About Me**: Started the 100DaysOfCode challenge today, focusing on learning Python. I work on AWS/GCP in the DevOps space but I'm a newbie coder with very basic knowledge/skills to date. Looking to use this commnunity to hold myself accountable and stop making excuses why im russbish at coding.

To begin with I wont be working on projects whilst i get a proper handel on the basics, hopefully thats something i'll be capable of by day 30.

**Today's Progress**: Today ive been working with operators(= == != < >), control flow and conditionals, if/else/elif.

**Thoughts:** I now have a good handel on the above concepts, still have a bit mote work to do on if/elif/else, wil have another hour on this subject tomorrow before moving on.

**Todays Output:** Today ive been working on writing a BMI calculator and also an app to tell you if i given year is a leap year.


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
