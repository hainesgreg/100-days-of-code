# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday 21st Nov 2022

**About Me**: Started the 100DaysOfCode challenge today, focusing on learning Python. I work on AWS/GCP in the DevOps space but I'm a newbie coder with very basic knowledge/skills to date. Looking to use this commnunity to hold myself accountable and stop making excuses why im russbish at coding.

To begin with I wont be working on projects whilst i get a proper handel on the basics, hopefully thats somehtung i'll be capable of by day 30.

**Today's Progress**: Today ive been working with control flow and conditionals, if/else/elif.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
