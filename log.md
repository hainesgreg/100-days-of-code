# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tues 22nd Nov 2022 (operators(= == != < >), control flow, intro to conditionals(if/else/elif)

**About Me**: I started the 100DaysOfCode challenge today, focusing on learning Python. I work in the cloud computing domain (AWS/GCP) and have good open source tooling knowlegde (Terraform, Docker etc), but my coding skills (or lack of) have always held me back. I've attempted to learn to code more time that I care to remember, today I made the decision to stop making excuses, today is the day I hold myself accountable. 

To begin with I wont be working on projects whilst i get a proper handel on the basics, hopefully this is something i'll be capable of by day 30.

**What I Covered Today**: Today ive been working with operators(= == != < >), control flow and had an intro to conditionals(if/else/elif).

**Thoughts:** I now have a good handel on the above concepts, still have a bit mote work to do on if/elif/else, wil have another hour on this subject tomorrow before moving on.

**Todays Output:** Today ive been working on writing a BMI calculator and also an app to tell you if a given year is a leap year, or not.


### Day 2: Weds 23rd, Nov 2022 (conditionals, nested and multiple if statements)

**What I Covered Today**: Continued on with conditionals today, nested and multiple if statements.

**Thoughts**: Was difficult to understand to begin with but got my head around it eventually. Still a bit more on conditionals to do tomorrow, where we take a look at logical operators(AND / OR / NOT). 

**Todays Output:** I worked on a writing a pizza order app where i got to put my nested and multiple if statement knowledge to the test.


### Day 3: Friday 25th, Nov 2022 (logical operators AND/ OR/ NOT)

**What I Covered Today**: Continued on with conditionals and tackled logical operators (AND / OR / NOT) today.

**Thoughts** The introduction of logical operator answered a few questions i had going around in my head, together with conditionals they start to make things make more sense. Only the final project left in this section where all of the skills used thus far will come into play, will tackle that on Monday as its the weekend tomorrow and my head needs a rest. Very much enjoying the journey so far, taking small bitesize chunks of information onboard is working well for me so will continue in this fashion going forward. 

***Todays Output:** I created a true love calculator where you had to use the logical operator knowledge and also some built-in functions too, (count) and (lower).

### Day 5: Monday 28th, Nov 2022 (lists, indexing, random, split)

**What I Covered Today**: Started learning Lists[] and indexing them today. Also got exposure to the more functions, random and split. Not feeling very well today so its been a pretty slow day, finding it hard to concentrate.

### Day 6: Monday 5th, Dec 2022 (lists, indexing, random, split)

**What I Covered Today**: After spending the last week laid up in bed it was back to the grind today as i continued on with learning about lists and indexing. Today also involved creating a rock/paper/scissors game where i needed to lean on my knowldge of if/elif/else statements, use of the random function and also ascii art for producing basic images. 

I then moved on and tackled for loops and also got introduced to the the range function and created a Fizzbuzz game. For the end project in this section i was tasked with creating a random password generator. This was quite difficult but also very intersting. 

***Todays Output:** 
Check out my rock/paper/scissors game created in Replit.

### Day 7: Tuesday 6th, Dec 2022 (while loops)

**What I Covered Today**: Today I started leraning about functions and while loops and how they compare to for loops. Also stated using Reeborg's world which is quite similar to Karel the robot which ive used briefly before. Its really good to help you start with thinking like a programmer.

Will continue on with functions and while loops tomorrow before moving on to the next section.  

**Thoughts**: Still only dedicating small chunks of time per day, about an hour in total. This is still working well so will continue on doing so for the time being. 

### Day 8: Thursday 8th, Dec 2022 (while loops)

**What I Covered Today**: Finished up with while loops today, still dont fully understand them just yet so will come back to them later in the course so that i dont stall my progress too much. Also made a start on the Hangman section of the course today, will make more of a dent in that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: The concepts are now getting more difficult and its at the point in the course where i'd usually start to struggle and likely quit. Need to buckle down and persevere, I wont be beaten this time. Its the Endava Christmas party in London tonight so tomorrow will probably be a slow day as my brain will be working way below optimum.


### Day 9 and 10 : Friday 9th/Tuesday 13th, Dec 2022 (hangman task, lots to cover)

**What I Covered Today**: The last 2 days ive spent working on the hangman challenge which involved breaking down the pretty complex task of creating a hangman game. It involved using many of the skills learnt to date and was quite difficult for someone with my level of coding knowledge. I had to watch the solution videos a few times and needed help to complete this one. Will probably return to this task when i havwe more experience.

The task involved coding below:
1) Picking random words from a list and checking the awnsers
2) Replacing blanks with guesses
3) Checking if a player has won
4) Keep track of a players lives
5) Improve the user experience and add ASCII art (still TODO, will tackle that part tomorrow)

### Day 11 and 12 : Weds 14th/Thurs 14th, Dec 2022 (finished the hangman task, intro to functions with inputs)

**What I Covered Today**: Yesterday i completed the hangman task, lots learnt throughout this processs as documented above. Many of the skills learnt will no doubt come in handy when tackling similar tasks in the coming days/weeks.

Started on the intro to functions with inputs today, looking forward to covering this section so i can start apply the knowledge in my tasks at work.

### Day 13, 14, 15 : Monday 19th, Tue 20th, Thurs 22nd Dec 2022 

**What I Covered Today**: It's been a very slow week due to increased work commitments and my daughter Nelly has being off nursurey all week very ill, poor thing. Yes its been slow and ive not got much done this week but I'm not going to read too much into it, these things happen and cant be helped. I also break up for Christmas tomororw so over the next 2 weeks i'll be taking a step back from both work and coding as therer are more important things in life.

Over the last 3 days ive continued working with functions and inputs and also understanding parameters and arguments in mored detail. I then worked on creating an area calculator which involed using the math function. 

Im now working on creating a cipher app where you enter a word and either encode or decrypt it by shifting the letters. This task will be broken down into 4 parts.

**Part 1**
**Encryption**
#1)Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs
#2)Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
#3)Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message. 

**Part 2
Decryption**

**Part 3
Reorganising our code**

**Part 4
Improvements and user experience **
