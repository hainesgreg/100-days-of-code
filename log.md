# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tues 22nd Nov 2022

**About Me**: I started the 100DaysOfCode challenge today, focusing on learning Python. I work in the cloud computing domain (AWS/GCP) and have good open source tooling knowlegde (Terraform, Docker etc), but my coding skills (or lack of) have always held me back. I've attempted to learn to code more time that I care to remember, today I made the decision to stop making excuses, today is the day I hold myself accountable. 

To begin with I wont be working on projects whilst i get a proper handel on the basics, hopefully this is something i'll be capable of by day 30.

**Today's Progress**: Today ive been working with operators(= == != < >), control flow and conditionals(if/else/elif).

**Thoughts:** I now have a good handel on the above concepts, still have a bit mote work to do on if/elif/else, wil have another hour on this subject tomorrow before moving on.

**Todays Output:** Today ive been working on writing a BMI calculator and also an app to tell you if a given year is a leap year, or not.


### Day 2: Weds 23rd, Nov 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with conditionals today, nested and multiple if statements.

**Thoughts**: Was difficult to understand to begin with but got my head around it eventually. Still a bit more on conditionals to do tomorrow before i can wrap this section up and move on.

**Link(s) to work**: I worked on a writing a pizza order app where i got to put my nested and multiple if statement knowledge to the test.
